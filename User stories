## 🧠 1. The Casual AI Enthusiast (Social Media → Community → Event)

**As a casual browser and AI lover living in Canberra,**  
I want to see funny and insightful memes about AI while scrolling Instagram, so I feel entertained and subtly informed.  

One day, I came across a meme from *Southern Cross AI* about Joey — the Aussie LLM — and it made me laugh and curious at the same time.

A few days later, I saw a post about an upcoming **Southern Cross AI community event** happening in Sydney. The post had clear info and a call to join the Discord for details. I followed the link, joined the community, and started chatting with people who were just as into AI as I was.

Excited and welcomed, I attended the event. There, I met students, developers, and creators working on actual AI projects — it was inspiring! I left with new friends and a stronger interest in being part of the community long-term.

## 💼 2. The Researcher Seeking Collaboration

**As an AI researcher at an Australian university,**  
I want to quickly understand what Southern Cross AI is, what projects they’re working on, and whether they align with my interests.

I found the Southern Cross AI website via LinkedIn, and it had clear pages explaining the Joey LLM project and community goals. The site’s simple layout and Jekyll-enhanced content made it easy to navigate. I found the “Join Us” section with a Discord invite and jumped into the community to explore collaborations or potential student outreach.

## 🖼️ 3. The Creative Contributor (Content Designer)

**As a visual content creator who supports open-source communities,**  
I want to use pre-made templates and brand assets from Southern Cross AI so I can help design posters and share updates.

I discovered the community through Twitter, saw their GitHub, and found an Adobe Express brand kit with meme templates and graphics. It made it easy for me to contribute high-quality content that matched the existing visual identity. I felt part of the mission — even without writing code — by helping Southern Cross AI reach more people with beautiful, engaging posts.

## 🎓 4. The University Student Discovering the Community

**As a university student studying data science,**  
I want to find meaningful communities where I can grow outside the classroom.

I heard about Southern Cross AI from a friend, visited the website, and joined the Discord through the “Get Involved” page. Inside the server, I found channels about AI news, model training, and Aussie-focused projects. I liked how the team hosted events and workshops and even had a podcast. I listened to one episode and realized how accessible the discussions were. That pushed me to start engaging and even consider contributing to the site!

## 🛠️ 5. The Developer Interested in Open Source

**As a software developer looking to contribute to AI projects,**  
I want to see a clearly organized GitHub with open issues, a roadmap, and an explanation of how Joey works.

I came across Southern Cross AI through Reddit and visited their website, which had a clean, fast layout with links to GitHub and documentation. From there, I saw their roadmap on GitHub Projects and picked up a "good first issue" related to the community site. The project felt active and well-managed, and I appreciated how the AmplifyAI team used GitHub Backlogs to assign and label tasks.

**As a podcast listener who enjoys staying updated on AI trends,**  
I stumbled upon the Southern Cross AI podcast on YouTube. It was a short, local-feeling episode about building Joey, and it made AI feel more accessible. The hosts were relaxed and informative.

I found a link to the Discord in the description, joined the community, and eventually started helping promote the podcast on social media. I even pitched a new episode topic in the Discord!

## 📢 7. The Stakeholder / Project Lead

**As a Southern Cross AI project lead,**  
I want to receive weekly updates from the AmplifyAI team that show website progress, social media engagement, and community milestones.

This helps me ensure that the outreach strategy aligns with the broader goals of the Southern Cross AI initiative. When I see consistent progress posted in GitHub issues and weekly reports during Friday check-ins, I’m reassured that the AmplifyAI team is on track.
