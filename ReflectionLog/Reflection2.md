| Written Records of Internal Communication | - Most team discussions in Sprint 1 were face-to-face or voice chats without documentation.                | - The tutor emphasized the need to leave written evidence of collaboration, such as Discord chat logs or team meeting records.                | - Started capturing important Discord messages with screenshots.<br>- Created and archived team meeting records after each internal discussion.              | Internal communication is now documented and can be reviewed later by team members and external reviewers.                                                         | Yuhang Chen     |
| Time Details in Backlog Issues            | - We created GitHub backlog issues without clear time planning.                                            | - The tutor reminded us to specify start time, end time, and estimated duration for each issue.<br>- Lack of timing made planning invisible. | - Added a time-tracking section to the issue template.<br>- All members updated existing issues with start/end dates and estimated durations.                | Our Sprint 2 backlog now includes timing information, allowing better progress tracking and evaluation of execution discipline.                                  | All Members     |
| Detailed Task Descriptions & Effort       | - Some task descriptions were too brief and lacked concrete execution or effort explanation.               | - The tutor advised us to clearly explain what was done and how much effort was invested.                                                     | - Improved task descriptions by listing step-by-step actions and clarifying the implementation process.                                                      | Task processes and effort are now more transparent, helping stakeholders better understand contributions.                                                         | All Members     |
| Peer Review for Each Task                 | - Some tasks were collaborative, but no peer evaluation or feedback was included.                          | - The tutor suggested that group members should comment under each task to reflect group-based work, not just individual actions.            | - After completing any task, team members now give feedback and quality evaluations to ensure team collaboration is visible.                                | Every task now includes peer comments, reinforcing a collaborative working structure.                                                                             | All Members     |
| Post-Meeting Task Allocation Tracking     | - Meeting notes were recorded, but task assignment afterwards wasn‚Äôt clearly documented.                   | - The tutor pointed out a missing link between meeting outcomes and task distribution workflow.                                               | - After each meeting, sub-issues are created under the meeting issue to map discussion points to tasks and assignees.                                        | Meeting decisions now flow clearly into task execution, making workflow transparent to both internal and external stakeholders.                                  | All Members     |
