| Written Records of Internal Communication  | - During Sprint 1, most internal discussions were held face-to-face or via voice chat without documentation. | - Tutor emphasized the importance of maintaining written records, such as Discord chat logs or internal meeting notes, to prove collaboration. | - Started capturing key messages on Discord through screenshots.<br>- After each internal meeting, a team meeting record is written and stored in a shared folder. | Our internal communication is now well documented and can be reviewed later or shared with external reviewers.             | üßë‚Äçüíª Yuhang Chen  |
| Time Details in Backlog Issues             | - We created issues in GitHub‚Äôs backlog but did not include specific timeframes.                            | - Each issue should specify start date, end date, and estimated duration.<br>- Without these, external reviewers can‚Äôt assess planning quality. | - Added time tracking fields in the issue template.<br>- All members updated existing issues with start/end dates and estimated duration.                         | The Sprint 2 backlog now includes clear timeframes, making it easier to track progress and assess execution efficiency.     | üë• All Members   |
| Detailed Task Descriptions & Effort Shown  | - Some task descriptions were vague and lacked detailed execution steps or workload indicators.             | - Tutor advised that each task should reflect what was done and how much effort it required to showcase value and process.                  | - Improved the structure of issue descriptions by listing specific actions taken and summarizing the work done.                                                   | The process and effort behind each task are now more transparent, supporting better evaluation.                             | üõ† Entire Team   |
| Peer Review for Each Task                  | - Although some tasks were done collaboratively, there were no peer evaluations or feedback.                | - Tutor emphasized that team members should comment and assess the quality of completed tasks to reflect group work and collaboration.       | - After each task is completed, group members are required to provide evaluations and feedback to reflect the real collaboration process.                         | Peer feedback is now included in all tasks, highlighting teamwork rather than individual execution.                         | üë• Entire Team   |
| Post-Meeting Task Allocation Tracking      | - While we recorded meetings with the tutor and client, we didn‚Äôt show how tasks were assigned afterward.   | - Lacked a clear workflow to show how discussion points turned into specific tasks and assignments.                                        | - For every meeting issue, sub-issues are now created to link discussed tasks directly with assignees and responsible members.                                    | Task delegation is now traceable from discussion to execution, offering transparency for both the team and external viewers. | üë• Entire Team   |
