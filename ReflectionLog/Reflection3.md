| **Personal Reflection Diary** | Reflections in Sprint 2 were mostly at the group level, lacking personal insights.  | Group-level reflections cannot fully capture individual experiences and growth.                        | Each member will submit a personal reflection on Wattle covering Sprints 1 to 3: what they learned, challenges faced, and how they plan to improve.           | All Members       |
| **Forward-looking Reflection**| Sprint 2 reflections focused on what was done, without evaluating or future planning. | Reflection should also identify problems and propose improvements for the next sprint.                | The reflection template was updated. After each task, members will assess whether problems occurred and suggest specific improvements for Sprint Planning.     | All Members       |
