| 🌟 **Reflection Area** | 🧠 **Background** | ⚠️ **Problems Identified** | 🔧 **What We Improved** | ✅ **Outcome / Notes** | 👥 **Executor** |
|------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **🛠 Workflow Management Enhancement** | - Last semester, our tutor mentioned the workflow was unclear.<br>- The process of task discussion, assignment, and execution was not visible from outside. | - Workflow lacked transparency.<br>- The process looked like a "black box" to our tutor — no visibility into how tasks were handled. | - Introduced **GitHub Projects** for end-to-end task tracking.<br>- Documented each stage: discussion, assignment, progress, deadlines.<br>- Enabled **real-time tracking** and agile adjustments. | Workflow is now fully transparent, traceable, and easy to review by external parties like the tutor. | 👨‍💻 Project Team |
| **📝 SOW Update** | - On **March 21st**, we completed our first draft of the Statement of Work (SOW).<br>- Tutor emphasized the importance of **clear phase objectives** and **execution planning**. | - Phase objectives were too vague.<br>- Lack of clarity on planning, task breakdown, and roles. | - Refined each phase’s objectives to be **clear and measurable**.<br>- Added **detailed planning**, including task distribution, timelines, and responsibilities.<br>- Included **milestone descriptions** for better tracking. | The revised SOW provides a more structured and practical foundation for team alignment and project execution. | 👩‍💼 Xuefei Luan |
