# 📘 Project Reflection 

## 1️⃣ Tutor & Client Feedback Reflection

This table summarizes the key challenges we encountered during our project, as well as the feedback and suggestions provided by our **tutor** and **client**. It also outlines how we responded and improved our workflow and documentation accordingly.

| 🌟 **Reflection Area** | 🧠 **Background** | ⚠️ **Problems Identified** | 🔧 **What We Improved** | ✅ **Outcome / Notes** | 👥 **Executor** |
|------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **🛠 Workflow Management Enhancement** | - Last semester, our tutor mentioned the workflow was unclear.<br>- The process of task discussion, assignment, and execution was not visible from outside. | - Workflow lacked transparency.<br>- The process looked like a "black box" to our tutor — no visibility into how tasks were handled. | - Introduced **GitHub Projects** for end-to-end task tracking.<br>- Documented each stage: discussion, assignment, progress, deadlines.<br>- Enabled **real-time tracking** and agile adjustments. | Workflow is now fully transparent, traceable, and easy to review by external parties like the tutor. | 👨‍💻 Project Team |
| **📝 SOW Update** | - On **March 21st**, we completed our first draft of the Statement of Work (SOW).<br>- Tutor emphasized the importance of **clear phase objectives** and **execution planning**. | - Phase objectives were too vague.<br>- Lack of clarity on planning, task breakdown, and roles. | - Refined each phase’s objectives to be **clear and measurable**.<br>- Added **detailed planning**, including task distribution, timelines, and responsibilities.<br>- Included **milestone descriptions** for better tracking. | The revised SOW provides a more structured and practical foundation for team alignment and project execution. | 👩‍💼 Xuefei Luan |

## 4️⃣ 🔍 Sprint 1 Retrospective – Problem-Based Reflection

| ❗ Issue | 💡 Reflection & Lessons Learned | 🔧 Sprint 2 Improvement Actions |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Unclear Sprint Goals**<br>Lack of focus in tasks, and the team lacked a unified direction during execution. | Realized the importance of clear goals for task breakdown and execution focus. Without a clear goal, resources can be scattered and efficiency reduced. Sprint goals should be specific and measurable to keep the team aligned. | Set clear phase goals before starting the Sprint, break them into actionable sub-tasks, and display them on the project board to keep the team aligned and track progress. |
| **Delayed Task Process Updates, Lack of Visualization**<br>GitHub Project was not updated in time, and the process could not be viewed intuitively. | Learned the impact of timely and visible process records on team collaboration efficiency and external communication. | Establish a GitHub Project usage standard, ensuring that task statuses are updated in real-time and processes are transparent for team collaboration and external review. |
| **CSS Style Conflicts in Website Development**<br>Parallel development led to page layout issues, and styles conflicted with each other. | In frontend collaboration, the lack of unified style conventions led to conflicts between modules, impacting page stability. We realized the need to establish consistent development conventions to reduce interference. | In the next phase, we will attempt to unify style conventions and structure design, and explore frontend collaboration methods suited to the team to gradually reduce conflicts. |
